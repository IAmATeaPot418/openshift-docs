= Reissuing internal certificates for Scanner

Scanner has built-in certificates that it uses to communicate with Central and ScannerDB. 

The RHACS portal shows an information banner when the Scanner and ScannerDB certificates are about to expire.

[NOTE]
====
The information banner only appears 15 days before the certificate expiry date.

.Prerequisites

* To reissue certificates, you must have `write` permission for the `ServiceIdentity` resource.

.Procedure

. Click on the link in the banner to download a YAML configuration file, which contains a new {ocp} or Kubernetes secret, including the certificate and key values.
. Apply the new YAML configuration file to the cluster where you installed Scanner.

$ oc apply -f <secret_file.yaml>
----
** On Kubernetes:

. Restart Scanner and ScannerDB to apply the changes.
